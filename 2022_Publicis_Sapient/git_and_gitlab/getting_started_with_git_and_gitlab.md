## Steps
### Step 1. If you don't know how to open a Terminal window
You'll likely need to use a Terminal window often - here's <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#choose-a-terminal" target="_blank">How to open a Terminal window</a>
<table>
  <tr><td>If you're running macOS, you'll also need to install the Xcode command-line tools.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Step 2. If you don't know if you have Git installed
Git is likely already installed, but you need to know, so you'll have to <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#confirm-git-is-installed" target="_blank">check if you have Git installed</a>.
<table>
  <tr><td>If Git is not installed, you'll have to <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/how_to_install_git/" target="_blank">install Git</a>.</td></tr>
</table>

### Step 3. If you've not configured Git (you'll know)
Before you can use Git to interact with GitLab - you will have to <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#configure-git" target="_blank">configure Git</a> so that it can tell GitLab who you are.

### Step 4. If you've not got a Personal Access Token (you'll know)
Before you can use Git to interact with GitLab - you will also need a Personal Access Token. 
It's your special-purpose 'password' for GitLab - in PS Code:
1. In the **Profile** dropdown - click **Edit profile**
2. In **User Setting** - click **Access Tokens**
3. in the **Token name** field - enter a meaningful name (for example: ``my_personal_access_token``)
4. Under **Select scopes** - check all the checkboxes
5. Click the **Create personal access token** button - a *Personal Access Token* will be generated
6. As the message says "*Make sure you save it - you won't be able to access it again*"
