Although the code examples in our documentation are in Python, it is beyond the scope of our 
documentation to teach you Python programming.

However, if you can copy-and-paste code examples, and run Python code, you already know enough 
to follow our documentation.

## Getting Started with Document Extraction
To run the Python code examples it is presumed that you have:
* Installed **VS Code** (or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">get it</a><img src="external-link.png"/> and do so now)
* Installed **Python** (with pip) <a href="/python/installing-python.md" target="_blank">see how</a>
* Installed the **requests** package <a href="/requests/installing-requests.md" target="_blank">see how</a>
