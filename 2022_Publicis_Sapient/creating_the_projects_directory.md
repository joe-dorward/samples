The existence of a ``~/projects`` directory is recommended, but NOT mandated.

The ``~`` denotes your 'home' folder - so, the ``~/projects`` is a top-level folder.

At the Terminal prompt:
1. Type ``mkdir ~/projects``
2. Press the **Enter** key
3. Type ``ls -l``
4. Press the **Enter** key - you will see the newly created ``projects`` directory in the list of top-level folders
