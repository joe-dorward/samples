### User Entity creation
The Sage Provisioning Portal has three user-levels:
   * **Sage** Operating Company users
   * **Partner** organisation users
   * **Customer** organisation users

In a plausible scenario, a:
  * **Sage** Operating Company user would add a **Partner** organisation
  * **Partner** organisation user would add a **Customer** organisation  
  * **Partner** organisation user would add a **Site** for a **Customer** organisation  
  * **Customer** organisation user would launch the **Site**, and use the **Product** hosted by the **Site**
